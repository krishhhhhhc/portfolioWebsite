        <p>
            I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Sydney, passionate about cloud technologies, software development, and consulting. With hands-on experience in Python, Java, JavaScript, and UI/UX design, I've worked on cloud-based applications, data analysis, and automation projects.

            I've contributed to projects at DWS, RenoPilot, and SportsMate, focusing on cloud solutions, application development, and user experience enhancements. My leadership roles, including project management at Jacaranda Flame Consulting, have strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills.
            
            Beyond tech, I enjoy mentoring, football, and cooking. I'm always eager to learn, innovate, and make an impact in the digital space.
